# S3 Express WarpStream EKS

Configuration in this directory deploys a [low latency](https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/byoc/advanced-agent-deployment-options/low-latency-clusters) WarpStream cluster within EKS.

This deployment is similar to the [basic](../basic) but uses S3 Express to achieve lower latency then normal.
