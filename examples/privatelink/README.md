# Basic WarpStream EKS

This deployment is similar to the [basic](../basic) but uses a private link to communicate with the WarpStream
Control Plane.

Note: Private Link is only supported for [Pro & Enterprise](https://www.warpstream.com/pricing) clusters. The 
private link URL and service name will be shared when requested via our support channels.
